# Cookie Clicker

You're going to create a game using HTML, CSS and JS. The game is called Cookie Clicker.

The rules are simple:
* When the user clicks on the cookie, increment their score by 10 points
* That's it

You are expected to build out your own HTML, CSS and JS for this lab. An image of a cookie has been provided at `assets/images/cookie.png`. Additionally, a `mockup.png` has been provided to guide the structure and styling of your game user interface. Your submission should look just like the `mockup.png` file!

The font in the mock up is [Permanent Marker](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Permanent+Marker) from Google Fonts.

## Deliverables

### MVP (required)
To be considered complete, you are expected to turn in:
* an HTML file that passes HTML validation
* a CSS file that passes CSS validation
* JavaScript that runs without errors

Your submission should:
* closely match the appearance of the `mockup.png` file

Your submission should have the following behavior:
* when a user loads the page, their score starts at 0
* when a user clicks on the cookie, their score increases by 10 points

### Bonus (Optional)
Pick from the below optional bonus features:
* animate the size of the cookie when the user clicks on it
* count the users score up by 10 points when they click the cookie
* make it so the cookie is moving around the page (could be back and forth or up and down)
* Add multiple cookies of different sizes and different point values when clicked (i.e. a really small cookie that is difficult to click but worth 20 points)
